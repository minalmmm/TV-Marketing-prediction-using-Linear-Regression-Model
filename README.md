***TV Marketing Prediction by using Simple Regression Model***

*In this notebook, I have built a linear regression model to predict 'Sales' using 'TV' as the Independent variable.*

**Linear Regression model**
*Linear Regression model is one of the simplest predictive model in Machine Learning.
*It predicts by deriving a straight-line formula based on the data fit on it. But as simple as it is, Linear Regression can still be an effective model such as in use-cases like this.*

**1. Target Variable**
  
  *Sales*
